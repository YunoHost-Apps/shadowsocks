# Shadowsocks for Yunohost
The Shadowsocks local component  acts like a traditional SOCKS5 server and provides proxy service to clients.  It encrypts and forwards data streams and packets from the client to the Shadowsocks remote component, which decrypts and forwards to the target. Replies from target are similarly encrypted and relayed eventually returns to the original client.
